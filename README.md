## 🛠️ Areas of Focus

### Node.js & Express.js

I aim to improve my understanding and skills in building scalable backend applications using Node.js and Express.js.

### Authentication & Security

I'll be exploring various authentication techniques, including JWT and OAuth, while focusing on security best practices for backend systems.

### Databases: SQL and NoSQL

I'll dive deep into both relational (MySQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB) databases to understand how to design, query, and integrate them with backend applications.

### Portfolio Project

A key part of this journey is building and deploying a full-stack web application that demonstrates backend engineering skills, from RESTful APIs to user authentication.

### Professional Portfolio & CV

Throughout this journey, I will also be developing a personal portfolio website to showcase my projects, and creating a professional CV tailored to backend engineering internships.
